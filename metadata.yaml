description: Often referred to as the "American Agatha Christie," Mary Roberts Rinehart
  did much to popularize and refine the mystery genre in the United States. The Street
  of Seven Stars follows an American musician, Harmony Wells, to Austria, where she
  has gone to hone her violin skills. Though the dashing doctor she meets there appears
  to want to protect her, there may be more to his motives than meets the eye.
